# 🎵 Statistica 25 – Music Data Visualization Dashboard

This repository contains a **music data visualization project** built using **Python on Kaggle**, developed for **Statistica 25**, a data visualization hackathon organized during **Innovision**.

> 🎯 **Objective**: Explore and visualize insights from a music dataset containing over **20,000 tracks** using Python-based tools and libraries.
> 🧠 **Focus**: Category-wise analysis of features like danceability, energy, tempo, and genre distribution.
